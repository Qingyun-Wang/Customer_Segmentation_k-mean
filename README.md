# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation. The primary goal is to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and overall value to the company. This segmentation allows for more targeted marketing strategies and helps in making informed strategic business decisions.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**: Prepared the dataset by cleaning anomalies and engineered features to calculate the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values of each customer.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Utilized Scikit-learn to implement the K-Means algorithm, effectively grouping customers into three distinct clusters.
- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Created a 3D plot to visually represent the customer segments, facilitating an intuitive understanding of each clusterâ€™s characteristics and distribution.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas - For data manipulation
- Scikit-learn - For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm
- Matplotlib & Plotly - For creating visualizations
